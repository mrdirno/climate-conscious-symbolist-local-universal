- Write a scene where Elara tries to explain the 'buoy code' memory system to the mysterious surveyor.
- Draft the log entries of Old Man Miro from the day the last cod left, to the present 'clean pots.'

### Technical Entry Points

- Build an interactive map of Haven's End where environmental data (water temp, bird sightings, silence) layers over the geography.
